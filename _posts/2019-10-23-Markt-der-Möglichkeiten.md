During the "Markt der Möglichkeiten" our group tried to spread the word about OpenStreetMap and its use for humanitarian purposes. We could collect a good amount of possible new additions to our group and are now in the process of setting up an introductory meeting for all the newcomers that will happen on 7th November, 4pm on Campus 2. If you care to join, please drop us an e-mail so we can plan with the pc room capacities :)
