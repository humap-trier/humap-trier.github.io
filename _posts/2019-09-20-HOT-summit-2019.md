This year, the HOT Summit took place on 19th and 20th September in Heidelberg. It was a great experience to see the great community involved with HOT (Humanitarian **OpenStreetMap** Team) and the amazing work they do to help people in need. 
There were also some important take-aways concerning climate, as was emphasized by Catalina Jaime from the Red Cross Climate Center. Did you think the cost of doing nothing would be so high?
