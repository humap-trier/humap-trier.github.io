During yesterday's group meeting, we participated in Task *#5461 - South Cotabato, Philippines - Mapping for Food Security* with mapping roads, buildings and land use. 
There is still lots of work to be done in this project, that has been created by the YouthMappers network. According to the task description the region "grows almost half the country's food, yet remains the poorest population, with many communities at 30-70% poverty incidence".
