After "Markt der MÃ¶glichkeiten" at Trier University three weeks ago, we invited all interested people to an introductory meeting to our group, OpenStreetMap and Humanitarian OpenStreetMap. We were very happy to see we were able to fill up the whole room and with the help of the freshly introduced people get project #7045 of Missing Maps to 100%! 
This MissingMaps project is based in the Central African Republic, where MSF plans a survey in 2020 to improve the understanding of high mortality in the region due to a barely functioning health care system because of ongoing conflicts (https://tasks.hotosm.org/project/7045; #car_mortality_survey).
